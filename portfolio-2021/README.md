# Personal Portfolio 2021

A personal portfolio page built using React and styled-components.

## Features:

- Header 'typing' effect
- Sticky navbar on scroll
- API calls to Dev.to, YouTube, and Twitter for single-item social media carousels

### Still in progress:

I am in the process of revisiting old projects and refactoring them using my new knowledge as I go. Several small games, booking forms, and basic storage demonstrations are still in the project backlog.
